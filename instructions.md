# Game Instructions

## Overview

This is a basic game of Tic-Tac-Toe! For basic instructions on how to play Tic-Tac-Toe, please refer to this [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).

## How to Play

Upon visiting the web page, you should see a grid, some text above and to the side, and a button. What follows is a description of the function of each of these items:

### Text

There are two text items on the page. The first is the Welcome text displayed in blue. This is simply the title of the page.

The other text displayed on the page is the text indicating which player's turn it currently is. Upon first visiting the page, it should read "Next Turn X" but will change as the game advances. For example, after X plays, the text will then read "Next Turn O" and continue to switch as the game advances. Finally, if one player wins, this text will update to indicate which player won the game.

### Grid

This is the game area. This is where each player will make their moves. To make a move, the player will simply click the square they want to play in. After clicking, the square will display the player's piece (either an X or an O). After clicking, play immediately advances to the next player's turn.

### Button

The button on the page reads "Reset Game." This button enables the players to reset the game at any time. Upon clicking the button, the grid will be cleared and play will reset to player X's turn.

## Winning

As the game progresses, one player may win. When either player makes a winning move, the game immediately ends and the text is updated to indicate which player is victorious. At this point, the players may wish to click the "Reset Game" button to start a new game.
